# Get Involved — Opportunities for Trainers & Club Staff

As promised, here's a simple overview of a few **optional** ways you (and the team/PTs) can get more involved. Nothing is compulsory — just opportunities we've seen work really well elsewhere and that tend to be a great fit for Snap clubs.

## 1. Local Services Ads

> Easy upsell for the club

This lets you promote local businesses (physios, cafés, barbers, wellness services, etc.) directly to Snap members via our machines and app.

### Ad Packages (4 weeks)

| Tier | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Best Visibility** | £250 | Full video ad, home banner ad, business listing |
| **Great Visibility** | £50 | Home banner ad, business listing |
| **Basic Presence** | £20 | Business listing only |

All listings include an interactive business page accessible from the **Local Deals** section.

**Optional add-on:**
- Custom CTA (Voucher / Booking / Discount for Snap members) — £15 per 4 weeks

> **Referral commission:** 20% on anything you help bring in.

This is a really nice, low-effort way to support local businesses and create extra revenue for the club.

## 2. Trainers Programme — Bright.Coach

We're launching **Bright.Coach** for PTs across Snap. It's a brilliant way for trainers to earn more and deliver a more personalised member experience.

With the Bright.Coach app, PTs can:

- **Take payments easily** — Tap-on-Phone or payment links (like Cash App)
- **Charge for sessions** with zero friction
- **Access our retail catalogue** — supplements, equipment, tech, cosmetics, etc.
- **Create custom product bundles** tailored to their training programmes
- **Offer bundles** as part of a client's ongoing training plan

> **Retail commission for PTs:** 5%–15% (depending on status)

## 3. Restocking the Connected Retail Units

> Gig work opportunity

We operate a gig-based restocking network via our app. Restocking jobs are posted, and approved gig workers can apply.

We'd love to offer this to Snap team members and PTs first, as you're already on site and care about the member experience.

> **Per restock:** £20–£40 per visit (depending on location)

---

## 4. Optional: Local Stock Storage

In some cases, we also allow approved gig workers to store stock locally (subject to compliance and remote monitoring).

> **From £100 per month**, depending on volume and number of venues supported.

---

## 5. Bright.Blue Ambassador Opportunity

If this side of the business excites you, you can also become a **Bright.Blue Ambassador** and help introduce or even resell our connected retail solution into other suitable locations.

Depending on how involved you want to be — introductions only, closing deals, restocking, light maintenance — you can effectively **build your own small connected-retail business** with us.
