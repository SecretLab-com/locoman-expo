# Accessibility for Buttons

- Whenever you discover a button or tappable control without accessibility metadata, add `accessibilityRole="button"` and a clear `accessibilityLabel`.
- Add a stable `testID` for automation where possible (e.g., `tab-home`, `login-submit`, `catalog-tab-products`).
- Prefer updating shared components first (e.g., buttons, tabs, headers) to cover many screens at once.
